Meghan's Deviled Eggs
Yields approx. 10 deviled eggs


INGREDIENTS:

½ dozen eggs
3 ½ Tbsp mayo
1 Tbsp sweet relish
1/8 tsp salt
1/8 tsp pepper
Paprika to taste


DIRECTIONS:

1.	Hard boil eggs.  (Place the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan. Cover with at least an inch or
two of cold water. The more eggs that are crowding the pan the more water you should have over the eggs. Heat the pot
on high heat and bring the water to a full rolling boil.  Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit for about 15 minutes
to continue cooking.  After 15 minutes pour out hot water and cover eggs in cold water to stop cooking.)

2.	Peel eggs.

3.	Cut peeled eggs in half long-ways.  Pop out yolks and place in a mixing bowl.  Set egg whites aside on a serving
platter.

4.	In the mixing bowl, mix together the yolk with the mayo, sweet relish, salt, and pepper.  Blend until smooth and
creamy.

5.	Transfer yolk mixture to a plastic bag – only fill about halfway full at a time.  Cut a small corner of the bag
open so that you can squeeze out the yolk mixture.  For extra fancy eggs, you can use a cake decorating bag and tips.

6.	Pipe the egg yolk mixture into the egg white “wells.”  You can be as liberal as you like.  However, the more you
add to each egg the less deviled eggs you will be able to fill.  I find when I cook a dozen eggs I usually run out of
the yolk mixture about one full egg early (2 deviled eggs), per the yield amounts above.  This is ok, however,
because after peeling I usually have at least a couple “ugly” egg whites that I don’t care to use anyway.

7.	Finally, sprinkle paprika over the eggs and serve.
